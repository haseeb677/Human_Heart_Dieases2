# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on various medical attributes using multiple machine learning models. Built in **Jupyter Notebook** using Python, this is an ideal project for healthcare AI, academic submission, or portfolio demonstration.
